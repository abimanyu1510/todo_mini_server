# To-Do App with Authentication - Backend

## Project Overview
1. **Project Name**: To-Do App Backend
2. **Description**: A robust backend built with Express.js and MongoDB to support task management for the To-Do App.
3. **Database Management**: Utilized MongoDB for storing task data, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
4. **API Design**: Created RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks, ensuring seamless interaction with the frontend.
5. **Environment Configuration**: Managed environment variables using dotenv for secure configuration of sensitive information.
6. **Error Handling**: Implemented centralized error handling for consistent response formats and easier debugging.

## Features
1. CRUD operations for managing tasks (create, read, update, delete).
2. Secure data handling with proper validation and sanitization.
3. Real-time data synchronization with the frontend using webhooks or polling (if applicable).

## Technologies Used
1. Express.js
2. MongoDB
3. Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)
4. dotenv (for environment variable management)
5. Middleware (for error handling, etc.)

## Project Structure
- The backend is not structured using the MVC pattern, focusing instead on a simplified architecture for task management.
